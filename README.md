# Box-office-Revenue
🎬 Box Office Revenue Prediction
This project focuses on predicting the box office revenue of movies using machine learning techniques. Given various features like budget, runtime, cast, genres, production company, etc., the model estimates how much revenue a movie is likely to generate.

📌 Objective
To build a machine learning model that accurately predicts the box office revenue of movies using structured and unstructured data, such as numerical values, categorical features, and text descriptions.

🧠 Approach
Data Collection

Dataset sourced from public movie databases (e.g., Kaggle, TMDB).

Includes features like budget, release date, cast, crew, genres, production companies, and more.

Data Preprocessing

Handling missing values

Feature extraction from text (e.g., genres, cast names)

Encoding categorical variables

Normalization and scaling of numerical data

Feature Engineering

Extract year/month/day from release date

Number of production companies or cast members

Log transformation on skewed features (e.g., budget, revenue)

Model Building

Regression models: Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.

Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV

Evaluation using RMSE, MAE, and R² metrics

Prediction and Evaluation

Tested on unseen data

Compared model performance to choose the best-performing one

🚀 Technologies Used
Python

Pandas, NumPy

Scikit-learn

Matplotlib / Seaborn

XGBoost / LightGBM

Jupyter Notebook

📊 Sample Output
Model Accuracy (R² Score): ~0.80

RMSE: around $20M (depends on data)
